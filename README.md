OpenCV Code Examples in C++

Due to issues related with my university, I will no longer update this repository until after May 2016. Sorry.

# How to run Examples

Make sure you have cmake, gnu make, and GCC/Clang installed.

Also make sure you are using OpenCV3.1 which is the latest version available.

$ cmake .

$ make

$ ./example
